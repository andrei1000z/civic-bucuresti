/**
 * OpenStreetMap building footprint lookup for outage areas.
 *
 * For each outage with a (lat, lng, radius) we query the public
 * Overpass API for every `building=*` way inside that disc and return
 * the polygons. The map then paints each building in the outage's
 * type color — so users see "this exact block has no water" instead
 * of a vague colored circle.
 *
 * Costs:
 *   - ~5-10s per Overpass query (slow upstream, single shared node)
 *   - Building data is essentially static (changes once a year for a
 *     given block), so cache aggressively in Redis (24h TTL).
 *   - Falls back to empty array on failure — the existing colored
 *     circle still renders, so the page doesn't degrade visibly.
 *
 * Why server-side: Overpass is rate-limited per IP and applies CORS
 * preflight checks that are friendlier to a single backend. Doing it
 * client-side would (a) risk users hitting rate limits when refreshing
 * (b) break on iOS Safari which is strict about CORS preflights.
